If you are a community contributor, please **do not work on this issue if it is not assigned to you**.

If the issue is unassigned, in a comment, type `@gl-docsteam I would like to work on this issue.`
A technical writer will assign the issue to you. Then you can begin.
   
If someone has already chosen this issue, choose another issue, or view docs
[in the docs directory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/doc)
and open a merge request for any page you feel can be improved.

### To open a merge request and resolve the issue

1. Review the [merge request guidelines for contributors](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#merge-request-guidelines-for-contributors).

1. Review the [commit message guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/contributing/merge_request_workflow.html#commit-messages-guidelines).
   Use three to five words for your commit message, start with message with a capital letter, and do not end it in a period.
   Other commit messages can cause the pipeline to fail.

1. Create a merge request by following the instructions for [how to update the docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/workflow.html#how-to-update-the-docs).

   - Unless otherwise indicated, try to create only one merge request to address the issue.
   - When you create the merge request, select the **Documentation** merge request description template.
   - In the merge request's description, add a link to this issue.

Thank you again for contributing to the GitLab documentation!

### A few additional notes

- If you were not assigned the issue, do not create a merge request. It will not be accepted.
- If this issue is for a Hackathon, do not create the merge request before the Hackathon has started
  or it will not count towards the Hackathon.
- If you notice issues in the doc that you'd like to fix, but they're not part of the issue, open separate merge requests.

## Documentation issue

<!--
* Describe the issue. If the item is from an automated test,
* include a copy/paste from the the test results.
* [This issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/339543) is an example of text to include with a Vale issue.
*
* Limit the work to a reasonable amount. For example, you might have
* several moderate changes on one page, a few intermediate changes across five pages, or several very small
* changes for up to 10 pages. Break larger items into smaller issues to better distribute
* the opportunities for contributors.
*
* If you expect the work to take more than one MR to resolve, explain approximately
* how many MRs you expect to receive for the issue.
