<!--
Triage of infradev Issues is desired to occur asynchronously. There is also
a section of the Weekly GitLab SaaS meeting which aims to address anything
requiring synchronous discussion or which hasn't been triaged. This meeting has
time constraints and many of the participants may not have a detailed
understanding of the problems being presented. For maximum efficiency, please
ensure the following, so that your infradev issues can gain maximum traction.

-->

## Summary
<!--
Clearly state the scope of the problem, and how it affects GitLab.com
-->


## Impact
<!--
- Quantify the effect of the problem to help ensure that correct prioritization occurs.
- Include costs to availability. The Incident Budget Explorer dashboard can help here.
- Include the number of times alerts have fired owing to the problem, how much time was spent dealing with the problem, and how many people were involved.
- Include screenshots of visualization from Grafana or Kibana.
- Always include a permalink to the source of the screenshot so that others can investigate further.
-->


## Recommendation
<!--
Provide a clear, unambiguous, self-contained solution to the problem.
-->


## Verification
<!--
Provide a method for validating that the original issue still exists.

Having a way of checking validity can save on a great deal of back-and-forth discussion between Infradev Triage participants including Engineering Managers, Directors and Product Managers and make space for other non-resolved issues to get scheduled sooner.

Ideally, provide a link to a Thanos query or an ELK query and clear instructions on how to interpret the results to determine whether the problem is still occurring.
