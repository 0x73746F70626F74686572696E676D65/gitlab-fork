    All [security report schema](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/security-report-schemas) versions before 15.0.0 are considered deprecated in GitLab %15.8. Specifically, all [schemas](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/lib/ee/gitlab/ci/parsers/security/validators/schemas) that match 14.*.* will be deprecated.

    Please note that any [security report scanner integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html) with GitLab using a deprecated schema version will result in a deprecation warning as a result of [report validation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html#report-validation).
