# This is a template for a feature deprecation
# A deprecation typically occurs when a feature or capability is planned to be removed in a future release.
# Deprecations should be announced at least two releases prior to removal.  Any breaking changes should only be done in major releases.
#
# Below is an example of what a single entry should look like, it's required attributes,
# and what types we expect those attribute values to be.
#
# For more information please refer to the handbook documentation here:
# {{LINK TBD}}
