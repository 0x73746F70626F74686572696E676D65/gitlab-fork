    In alignment with the [GitLab Runner container images support policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/docker.html#gitlab-runner-container-images-support-lifecycle), as of GitLab 16.1, we have stopped publishing runner images based on the following end-of-life Alpine versions:

    - Alpine 3.12
    - Alpine 3.13
    - Alpine 3.14

    We recommend that customers use GitLab Runner versions published with Alpine 3.15 or 3.16.
