    <!-- START OF BODY COMMENT

    This area supports markdown.  Delete this entire comment and replace it with your markdown content.

    Removals must be actionable.

    Use terms such as "removed in favor of" or "use X instead." If no replacement is available, the action would be, "Discontinue use of foo immediately."

    For example:

    - The `confidential` field for a `Note` is removed. Use `internal` instead.
    - The `merge_status` field in the merge request API has been removed in favor of `detailed_merge_status`.
    - The `notable` endpoint has been removed. Discontinue use of `notable` immediately.

    When ready, assign to your tech writer for review. When ready, they will run `bin/rake gitlab:docs:compile_removals` to update the removals doc, then merge.
