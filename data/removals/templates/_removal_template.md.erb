# Removals by version

In each release, GitLab removes features that were [deprecated](deprecations.md) in an earlier release.
Some features cause breaking changes when they are removed.

**{rss}** **To be notified of upcoming breaking changes**,
add this URL to your RSS feed reader: `https://about.gitlab.com/breaking-changes.xml`
