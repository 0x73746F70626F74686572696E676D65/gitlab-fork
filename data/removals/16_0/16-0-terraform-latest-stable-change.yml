    With every major GitLab version, we update the stable Terraform templates with the current latest templates.
    This change affects the [quickstart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml)
    and the [base](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform/Base.gitlab-ci.yml) templates.

    The new templates do not change the directory to `$TF_ROOT` explicitly: `gitlab-terraform` gracefully
    handles directory changing. If you altered the job scripts to assume that the current working directory is `$TF_ROOT`, you must manually add `cd "$TF_ROOT"` now.

    Because the latest template introduces Merge Request Pipeline support which is not supported in Auto DevOps,
    those rules are not yet integrated into the stable template.
    However, we may introduce them later on, which may break your Terraform pipelines in regards to which jobs are executed.

    To accommodate the changes, you might need to adjust the [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules) in your
    `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
