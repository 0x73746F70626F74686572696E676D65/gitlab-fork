    The Azure Storage Driver used to write to `//` as the default root directory. This default root directory appeared in some places in the Azure UI as `/<no-name>/`. We maintained this legacy behavior to support older deployments using this storage driver. However, when moving to Azure from another storage driver, this behavior hides all your data until you configure the storage driver with `trimlegacyrootprefix: true` to build root paths without an extra leading slash.

    In GitLab 16.0, the new default configuration for the storage driver uses `trimlegacyrootprefix: true`, and `/` is the default root directory. You can set your configuration to `trimlegacyrootprefix: false` if needed, to revert to the previous behavior.
