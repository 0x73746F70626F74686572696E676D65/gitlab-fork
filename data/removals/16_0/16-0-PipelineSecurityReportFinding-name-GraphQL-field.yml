    Previously, the [PipelineSecurityReportFinding GraphQL type was updated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335372) to include a new `title` field. This field is an alias for the current `name` field, making the less specific `name` field redundant. The `name` field is removed from the PipelineSecurityReportFinding type in GitLab 16.0.
