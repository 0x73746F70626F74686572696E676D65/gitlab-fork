  body: |
    Previously, Gitaly configuration keys for Omnibus GitLab were scattered throughout the configuration file. In GitLab
    15.10, we added support for a single configuration structure that matches Gitaly internal configuration. Both methods
    of configuring Gitaly were supported in parallel.

    In GitLab 16.0, we removed support for the former configuration method and now only support the new configuration
    method.

    Before upgrading to GitLab 16.0, administrators must migrate to the new single configuration structure. For
    instructions, see [Gitaly - Omnibus GitLab configuration structure change](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#gitaly-omnibus-gitlab-configuration-structure-change).
