  body: |
    The `VulnerabilityFindingDismiss` GraphQL mutation has been removed. This mutation was not used often as the Vulnerability Finding ID was not available to users (this field was [deprecated in 15.3](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#use-of-id-field-in-vulnerabilityfindingdismiss-mutation)). Instead of `VulnerabilityFindingDismiss`, you should use `VulnerabilityDismiss` to dismiss vulnerabilities in the Vulnerability Report or `SecurityFindingDismiss` for security findings in the CI Pipeline Security tab.
