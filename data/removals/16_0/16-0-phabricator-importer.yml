    The [Phabricator task importer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/phabricator.html) was deprecated in
    GitLab 15.7 and is removed in 16.0.

    The Phabricator project hasn't been actively maintained since June 1, 2021. We haven't observed imports using this
    tool. There has been no activity on the open related issues on GitLab.
