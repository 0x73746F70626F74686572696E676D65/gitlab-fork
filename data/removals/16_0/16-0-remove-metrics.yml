  body: |
    We previously launched a solution that allows you to view performance metrics by displaying data stored in a Prometheus instance.
    The Prometheus instance can be set up as a GitLab-managed app or you can connect a previously configured Prometheus instance.
    The latter is known as an "external Prometheus" in GitLab. The value we provided was to enable you to easily set up monitoring
    (using GitLab Managed Apps) and have the visualization of the metrics all in the same tool you used to build the application.

    However, as we are removing certificate-based integrations, the full monitoring experience is also deprecated as you will not
    have the option to easily set up Prometheus from GitLab. Furthermore, we plan to consolidate on
    a focused observability dashboard experience instead of having multiple paths to view metrics. Because of this, we are also removing the external
    Prometheus experience, together with the metrics visualization capability.

    This removal only refers to the GitLab Metrics capabilities, and **does not** include:

    - Deprecating [alerts for Prometheus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/338834).
    - [Capabilities that GitLab comes with that allow operators of GitLab to retrieve metrics from those instances](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/prometheus/gitlab_metrics.html).
