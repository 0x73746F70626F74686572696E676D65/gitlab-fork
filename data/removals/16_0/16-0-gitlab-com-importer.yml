    The [GitLab.com importer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/gitlab_com.html) was deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and is removed in GitLab 16.0.

    The GitLab.com importer was introduced in 2015 for importing a project from GitLab.com to a self-managed GitLab instance through the UI.

    This feature was available on self-managed instances only. [Migrating GitLab groups and projects by direct transfer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrate-groups-by-direct-transfer-recommended)
    supersedes the GitLab.com importer and provides a more cohesive importing functionality.

    See [migrated group items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrated-group-items) and [migrated project items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/#migrated-project-items) for an overview.
