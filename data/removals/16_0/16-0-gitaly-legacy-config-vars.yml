  body: |
    The environment variables `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` were deprecated in GitLab 14.8 and are removed
    in GitLab 16.0. These variables are replaced with standard
    [`config.toml` Gitaly configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/reference.html).

    GitLab instances that use `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` and `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` to configure Gitaly must switch to configuring
    using `config.toml`.
