    From GitLab 16.0, any personal, project, or group access token [must have an expiration date](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/96594). If you create a personal access token with the GitLab Shell command `personal_access_token` without specifying `ttl_days`, a default value of 30 days is now applied.
