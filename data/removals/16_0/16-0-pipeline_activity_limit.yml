    The [**Maximum number of active pipelines per project** limit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.html#set-cicd-limits) has been removed. Instead, use the other recommended rate limits that offer similar protection:

    - [**Pipelines rate limits**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/rate_limit_on_pipelines_creation.html).
    - [**Total number of jobs in currently active pipelines**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.html#set-cicd-limits).
