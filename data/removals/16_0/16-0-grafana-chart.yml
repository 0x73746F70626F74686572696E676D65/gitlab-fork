  body: |  # (required) Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    The Grafana Helm chart that was bundled with the GitLab Helm Chart is removed in the GitLab Helm Chart 7.0 release (releasing along with GitLab 16.0).

    The `global.grafana.enabled` setting for the GitLab Helm Chart has also been removed alongside the Grafana Helm chart.

    If you're using the bundled Grafana, you should switch to the [newer chart version from Grafana Labs](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/grafana/grafana)
    or a Grafana Operator from a trusted provider.

    In your new Grafana instance, you can [configure the GitLab provided Prometheus as a data source](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration.html#integration-with-gitlab-ui)
    and [connect Grafana to the GitLab UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/monitoring/performance/grafana_configuration.html#integration-with-gitlab-ui).
  tiers: # (optional - may be required in the future) An array of tiers that the feature is available in currently.  e.g., [Free, Silver, Gold, Core, Premium, Ultimate]
