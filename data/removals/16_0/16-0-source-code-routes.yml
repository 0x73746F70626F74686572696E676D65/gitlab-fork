    GitLab 16.0 removes legacy URLs from the GitLab application.

    When subgroups were introduced in GitLab 9.0, a `/-/` delimiter was added to URLs to signify the end of a group path. All GitLab URLs now use this delimiter for project, group, and instance level features.

    URLs that do not use the `/-/` delimiter are planned for removal in GitLab 16.0. For the full list of these URLs, along with their replacements, see [issue 28848](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28848#release-notes).

    Update any scripts or bookmarks that reference the legacy URLs. GitLab APIs are not affected by this change.
