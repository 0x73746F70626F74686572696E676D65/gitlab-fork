    The [GitLab Conan repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/conan_repository/) supports the `conan search` command, but when searching a project-level endpoint, instance-level Conan packages could have been returned. This unintended functionality is removed in GitLab 16.0. The search endpoint for the project level now only returns packages from the target project.
