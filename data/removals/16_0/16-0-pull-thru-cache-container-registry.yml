        The Container Registry [pull-through cache](https://docs.docker.com/registry/recipes/mirror/) was deprecated in GitLab 15.8 and removed in GitLab 16.0. This feature is part of the upstream [Docker Distribution project](https://github.com/distribution/distribution) but we are removing that code in favor of the GitLab Dependency Proxy. Use the GitLab Dependency Proxy to proxy and cache container images from Docker Hub.
