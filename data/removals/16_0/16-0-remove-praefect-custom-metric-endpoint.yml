  body: |
    Support for using the `prometheus_exclude_database_from_default_metrics` configuration value was deprecated in
    GitLab 15.9 and is removed in GitLab 16.0. We made this change to improve the performance of Praefect.
    All metrics that scrape the Praefect database are now exported to the `/db_metrics` endpoint.

    You must update your metrics collection targets to use the `/db_metrics` endpoint.
