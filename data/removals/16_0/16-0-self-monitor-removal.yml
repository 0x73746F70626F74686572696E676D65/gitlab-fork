    GitLab self-monitoring project was meant to enable self-hosted GitLab administrators to visualize performance metrics of GitLab within GitLab itself. This feature relied on GitLab Metrics dashboards. With metrics dashboard being removed, self-monitoring project is also removed. We recommended that self-hosted users monitor their GitLab instance with alternative visualization tools, such as Grafana.
