    The `omniauth-cas3` gem that provides GitLab with the CAS OmniAuth provider is being removed. You can no longer authenticate into a GitLab instance through CAS. This gem sees very little use. [The gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/omniauth-cas3/) has not had a new release in almost 5 years, which means that its dependencies are out of date and required manual patching during GitLab's [upgrade to OmniAuth 2.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30073).
