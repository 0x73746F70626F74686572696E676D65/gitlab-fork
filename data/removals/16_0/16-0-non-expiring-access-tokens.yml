  body: |  # (required) Do not modify this line, instead modify the lines below.
    Currently, you can create access tokens that have no expiration date. These access tokens are valid indefinitely, which presents a security risk if the access token is
    divulged. Because expiring access tokens are better, from GitLab 15.4 we [populate a default expiration date](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/348660).

    In GitLab 16.0, any personal, project, or group access token that does not have an expiration date will automatically have an expiration date set at 365 days later than the current date.
