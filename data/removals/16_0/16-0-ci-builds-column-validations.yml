   Previously, only CI/CD [job names](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/index.html#job-name-limitations) had a strict 255-character limit. Now, more CI/CD keywords are validated to ensure they stay under the limit.

   The following to 255 characters are now strictly limited to 255 characters:

   - The `stage` keyword.
   - The `ref` parameter, which is the Git branch or tag name for the pipeline.
   - The `description` and `target_url` parameters, used by external CI/CD integrations.

   Users on self-managed instances should update their pipelines to ensure they do not use parameters that exceed 255 characters. Users on GitLab.com do not need to make any changes, as these parameters are already limited in that database.
