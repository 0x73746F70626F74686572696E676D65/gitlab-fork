    In GitLab 16.0 and later, the `CI_PRE_CLONE_SCRIPT` variable option on GitLab SaaS Runners has been removed. The `CI_PRE_CLONE_SCRIPT` variable enabled you to run commands in your CI/CD job before the runner executed `git-init` and `git-fetch`. You should use the `pre_get_sources_script` hook instead. For more information, see the blog post, [Guide to pre_clone_script changes on GitLab SaaS Linux Runners](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/03/27/changes-to-the-preclonescript/).
