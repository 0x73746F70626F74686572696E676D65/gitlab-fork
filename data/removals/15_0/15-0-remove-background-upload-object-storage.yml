    To reduce the overall complexity and maintenance burden of GitLab's [object storage feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html), support for using `background_upload` has been removed in GitLab 15.0.

    This impacts a small subset of object storage providers, including but not limited to:

    - **OpenStack** Customers using OpenStack need to change their configuration to use the S3 API instead of Swift.
    - **RackSpace** Customers using RackSpace-based object storage need to migrate data to a different provider.

    If your object storage provider does not support `background_upload`, please [migrate objects to a supported object storage provider](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/object_storage.html#migrate-objects-to-a-different-object-storage-provider).
