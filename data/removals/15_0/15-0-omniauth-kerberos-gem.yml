  description: |
    Omniauth-kerberos is no longer supported. This gem has not been maintained and has very little usage and therefore, we removed support for this authentication method and recommend using [spengo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO) instead. You can follow the [upgrade instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/kerberos.html#upgrading-from-password-based-to-ticket-based-kerberos-sign-ins) to upgrade from the removed integration to the new supported one. Note - We are not removing Kerberos SPNEGO integration, just the old password-based Kerberos.
