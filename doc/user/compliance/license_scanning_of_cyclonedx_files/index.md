# License scanning of CycloneDX files **(ULTIMATE)**

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384932) in GitLab 15.9 [with two flags](../../../administration/feature_flags.md) named `license_scanning_sbom_scanner` and `package_metadata_synchronization`. Both flags are disabled by default and both flags must be enabled for this feature to work.
> - [Enabled on GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385173) in GitLab 15.9.
> - [Enabled on self-managed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385173) in GitLab 15.10.

To detect the licenses in use, License Compliance relies on running the
[Dependency Scanning CI Jobs](../../application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md),
and analyzing the [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generated by those jobs.
Other 3rd party scanners may also be used as long as they produce a CycloneDX file with a list of dependencies for [one of our supported languages](#supported-languages-and-package-managers).
This method of scanning is also capable of parsing and identifying over 500 different types of licenses, as defined in [the SPDX list](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
Licenses not in the SPDX list are reported as "Unknown". License information can also be extracted from packages that are dual-licensed, or have multiple different licenses that apply.

To enable license detection using Dependency Scanning in a project,
include the `Jobs/Dependency-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml` template in its CI configuration,
but do not include the `Jobs/License-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml` template.

## Requirements

The license scanning requirements are the same as those for [Dependency Scanning](../../application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#requirements).

## Supported languages and package managers

License scanning is supported for the following languages and package managers:

The supported files and versions are the ones supported by
[Dependency Scanning](../../application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#supported-languages-and-package-managers).

## Configuration

To enable license scanning of CycloneDX files,
you must configure [Dependency Scanning](../../application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md#configuration).

## License expressions

GitLab has limited support for [composite licenses](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2-draft/SPDX-license-expressions/).
License compliance can read multiple licenses, but always considers them combined using the `AND` operator. For example,
if a dependency has two licenses, and one of them is allowed and the other is denied by the project [policy](../license_approval_policies.md),
GitLab evaluates the composite license as _denied_, as this is the safer option.
The ability to support other license expression operators (like `OR`, `WITH`) is tracked
in [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6571).

## Blocking merge requests based on detected licenses

Users can require approval for merge requests based on the licenses that are detected by configuring a [license approval policy](../license_approval_policies.md).

## Troubleshooting

### A CycloneDX file is not being scanned and appears to provide no results

Ensure that the CycloneDX file adheres to the [CycloneDX JSON specification](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/latest/json). This specification does [not permit duplicate entries](https://cyclonedx.org/docs/latest/json/#components). Projects that contain multiple SBOM files should either report each SBOM file up as individual CI report artifacts or they should ensure that duplicates are removed if the SBOMs are merged as part of the CI pipeline.

You can validate CycloneDX SBOM files against the `CycloneDX JSON specification` as follows:

```shell
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD:/my-cyclonedx-sboms" -w /my-cyclonedx-sboms cyclonedx/cyclonedx-cli:latest cyclonedx validate --input-version v1_4 --input-file gl-sbom-all.cdx.json

Validating JSON BOM...
BOM validated successfully.
