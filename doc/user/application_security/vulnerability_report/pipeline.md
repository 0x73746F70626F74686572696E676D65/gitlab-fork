# View vulnerabilities in a pipeline

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13496) in GitLab 12.3.

To view vulnerabilities in a pipeline:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **CI/CD > Pipelines**.
1. From the list, select the pipeline you want to check for vulnerabilities.
1. Select the **Security** tab.

**Scan details** shows vulnerabilities introduced by the merge request, in addition to existing vulnerabilities
from the latest successful pipeline in your project's default branch.

A pipeline consists of multiple jobs, such as SAST and DAST scans. If a job fails to finish,
the security dashboard doesn't show SAST scanner output. For example, if the SAST
job finishes but the DAST job fails, the security dashboard doesn't show SAST results. On failure,
the analyzer outputs an [exit code](../../../development/integrations/secure.md#exit-code).

## View total number of vulnerabilities per scan

To view the total number of vulnerabilities per scan:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **CI/CD > Pipelines**.
1. Select the **Status** of a branch.
1. Select the **Security** tab.

**Scan details** shows vulnerabilities introduced by the merge request, in addition to existing vulnerabilities
from the latest successful pipeline in your project's default branch.

## Download security scan outputs

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3728) in GitLab 13.10.
> - [Improved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333660) in GitLab 14.2.

Depending on the type of security scanner, you can download:

- A JSON artifact that contains the security scanner [report](../../../development/integrations/secure.md#report).
- A CSV file that contains URLs and endpoints scanned by the security scanner.

To download a security scan output:

1. On the top bar, select **Menu > Projects** and find your project.
1. On the left sidebar, select **CI/CD > Pipelines**.
1. Select the **Status** of a branch.
1. Select the **Security** tab.
1. In **Scan details**, select **Download results**:
    - To download a JSON file, select the JSON artifact.
    - To download a CSV file, select **Download scanned resources**.
