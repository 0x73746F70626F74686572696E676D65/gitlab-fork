WARNING:
This feature is in [Beta](../../../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#beta).
Due to high demand, this feature may have unscheduled downtime and Code Suggestions in IDEs may be delayed.
Code Suggestions may produce [low-quality or incomplete suggestions](#model-accuracy-and-quality).
Beta users should read about the [known limitations](#known-limitations). We look forward to hearing your feedback.

Write code more efficiently by using generative AI to suggest code while you're developing.

Code Suggestions are available:

- To users of both GitLab SaaS and self-managed GitLab.
- In Visual Studio Code when you have the GitLab Workflow extension installed.
- As Experiments for [additional IDEs](#enable-code-suggestions-in-other-ides-and-editors).

Usage of Code Suggestions is governed by the [GitLab Testing Agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/testing-agreement/).
Learn about [data usage when using Code Suggestions](#code-suggestions-data-usage).

## Supported languages

Code Suggestions may produce [low-quality or incomplete suggestions](#model-accuracy-and-quality).

Language support varies depending on which AI model serves Code Suggestions. To use Code Suggestions entirely within GitLab cloud infrastructure, disable third-party AI services. To receive higher quality suggestions, [enable third-party AI services](#third-party-ai-services-controls).

The best results from Code Suggestions are expected for these languages:

- **Third-party AI services (Google Codey)**: Go, Google Cloud CLI, Google SQL, Java, JavaScript, Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM), Python, Terraform, TypeScript.
- **GitLab first-party AI model**: C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Rust, Scala, TypeScript.

Suggestions may be mixed for other languages. Using natural language code comments to request completions may also not function as expected.

## Enable Code Suggestions on GitLab SaaS **(FREE SAAS)**

Code Suggestions can be enabled [for all members of a group](../../group/manage.md#enable-code-suggestions).

Each individual user must also choose to enable Code Suggestions.

### Enable Code Suggestions for an individual user

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/121079) in GitLab 16.1 as [Beta](../../../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#beta).

Each user can enable Code Suggestions for themselves:

1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Preferences**.
1. In the **Code Suggestions** section, select the **Enable Code Suggestions** checkbox.
1. Select **Save changes**.

If Code Suggestions is enabled for the group, the group setting overrides the user setting.

NOTE:
This setting controls Code Suggestions for all IDEs. Support for [more granular control per IDE](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10624) is proposed.

## Enable Code Suggestions on self-managed GitLab **(FREE SELF)**

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10653) in GitLab 16.1 as [Beta](../../../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#beta).

To enable Code Suggestions on a self-managed GitLab instance, you must:

- Be an administrator.
- Have a [GitLab SaaS account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up).
  You do not need to have a GitLab SaaS subscription.

Then, you will:

1. Enable Code Suggestions for your SaaS account.
1. Enable Code Suggestions for the instance.
1. Request early access to the Code Suggestions Beta.

### Enable Code Suggestions for your SaaS account

To enable Code Suggestions for your GitLab SaaS account:

1. Create a [personal access token](../../profile/personal_access_tokens.md#create-a-personal-access-token)
   with the `api` scope.
1. On the left sidebar, select your avatar.
1. Select **Preferences**.
1. In the **Code Suggestions** section, select **Enable Code Suggestions**.
1. Select **Save changes**.

### Enable Code Suggestions for the instance

You must enable Code Suggestions for the instance. When you do this, you:

- Agree to the [GitLab testing agreement](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/legal/testing-agreement/).
- Acknowledge that GitLab:
  - Sends data from the instance, including personal data, to Google for cloud hosting.
  - Might send data to third-party AI providers.

To enable Code Suggestions for your self-managed GitLab instance:

1. On the left sidebar, expand the top-most chevron (**{chevron-down}**).
1. Select **Admin Area**.
1. On the left sidebar, select **Settings > General**.
1. Expand **Code Suggestions** and:
   - Select **Turn on Code Suggestions for this instance**.
   - In **Personal access token**, enter your GitLab SaaS personal access token.
1. Select **Save changes**.

This setting is visible only in self-managed GitLab instances.

WARNING:
If you clear the **Turn on code suggestions for this instance** checkbox, the users in your instance can still use Code Suggestions for up to one hour, until the issued JSON web token (JWT) expires.

### Request access to Code Suggestions

GitLab provisions access on a customer-by-customer basis for Code Suggestions
on self-managed instances. To request access:

1. Sign into your GitLab SaaS account.
1. Comment on [issue 415393](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415393)
   and tag your customer success manager.

After GitLab has provisioned access to Code Suggestions for your instance,
the users in your instance can now enable Code Suggestions in VS Code.

## Enable Code Suggestions in other IDEs and editors

We have experimental support for Code Suggestions in Visual Studio, JetBrains, Neovim, Emacs, Sublime, etc.

More details in this [blog](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/06/01/extending-code-suggestions/).

## Use Code Suggestions

Prerequisites:

- For self-managed GitLab, Code Suggestions must be enabled [for the instance](#enable-code-suggestions-on-self-managed-gitlab).
- Code Suggestions must be enabled [for the top-level group](../../group/manage.md#enable-code-suggestions) and [for your user account](#enable-code-suggestions-for-an-individual-user).
- To use VS Code, ensure you have installed [the GitLab Workflow extension](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension#setup).

To use Code Suggestions:

1. Author your code. As you type, suggestions are displayed. Depending on the cursor position, the extension either:

   - Provides entire code snippets, like generating functions.
   - Completes the current line.

1. To accept a suggestion, press <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

Suggestions are best when writing new code. Editing existing functions or 'fill in the middle' of a function may not perform as expected.

GitLab is making improvements to the Code Suggestions underlying AI model weekly to improve the quality of suggestions. AI is non-deterministic, so you may not get the same suggestion week-to-week.

## Third-party AI services controls

Organizations can opt to use Code Suggestions entirely within GitLab cloud infrastructure. This option can be controlled with the top-level group [Third-party AI setting](../../group/manage.md#enable-third-party-ai-features).

Having the third-party AI setting enabled will allow Code Suggestions to use third-party AI services, which is likely to produce higher quality results. Please note that language support varies between the two options and will change over time.

To use Code Suggestions entirely within GitLabâ€™s cloud infrastructure, disable third-party AI services. You can disable Code Suggestions entirely in [your user profile settings](#enable-code-suggestions-for-an-individual-user).

## Stability and performance

This feature is currently in [Beta](../../../policy/experiment-beta-support.md#beta).
While the Code Suggestions inference API operates completely within the GitLab.com enterprise infrastructure,
we expect a high demand for this Beta feature, which may cause degraded performance or unexpected downtime
of the feature. We have built this feature to gracefully degrade and have controls in place to allow us to
mitigate abuse or misuse. GitLab may disable this feature for any or all customers at any time at our discretion.

## Code Suggestions data usage

Code Suggestions is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model hosted on GitLab.com.

Your personal access token enables a secure API connection to GitLab.com.
This API connection securely transmits a context window from VS Code to the Code Suggestions ML model for inference,
and the generated suggestion is transmitted back to VS Code.

Depending on your settings, different ML models will be used to provide Code Suggestions. GitLab currently leverages [Google Cloud's Vertex AI Codey API models](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/code/code-models-overview) for third-party AI powered Code Suggestions. The sections below refer only to GitLab first-party AI Model.

### Data privacy

This section applies only to customers who have third-party AI services disabled.

Code Suggestions operate completely in the GitLab.com infrastructure, providing the same level of
[security](https://about.gitlab.com/security/) as any other feature of GitLab.com, and processing any personal
data in accordance with our [Privacy Statement](https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/).

No new additional data is collected to enable this feature. The content of your GitLab hosted source code is
not used as training data. Source code inference against the Code Suggestions model is not used to re-train the model.
Your data also never leaves GitLab.com. All training and inference is done in GitLab.com infrastructure.

[Read more about the security of GitLab.com](https://about.gitlab.com/security/faq/).

### Self-managed instance data privacy

A self-managed GitLab instance does not generate the code suggestion. After successful
authentication to the self-managed instance, a token is generated.

The VS Code plugin then uses this token to securely transmit data directly to
GitLab.com's Code Suggestions service for processing.

The Code Suggestion service then securely returns an AI-generated code suggestion.

GitLab does not have any visibility into a self-managed customer's code other than
what is sent to generate the code suggestion.

### Training data

This section applies only to customers who have third-party AI services disabled.

Code Suggestions uses open source pre-trained base models from the
[CodeGen family](https://openreview.net/forum?id=iaYcJKpY2B_) including CodeGen-MULTI and CodeGen-NL.
We then re-train and fine-tune these base models with a customized open source dataset to enable multi-language
support and additional use cases. This customized dataset contains non-preprocessed open source code in 13
programming languages from [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/) and the
[Google BigQuery source code dataset](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/public-datasets/github-on-bigquery-analyze-all-the-open-source-code).
We then process this raw dataset against heuristics that aim to increase the quality of the dataset.

The Code Suggestions model is not trained on GitLab customer or user data.

## Progressive enhancement

This feature is designed as a progressive enhancement to developers IDEs.
Code Suggestions offer a completion if the machine learning engine can generate a recommendation.
In the event of a connection issue or model inference failure, the feature gracefully degrades.
Code Suggestions do not prevent you from writing code in your IDE.

### Internet connectivity

Code Suggestions does not work with offline environments.

To use Code Suggestions:

- On GitLab.com, you must have an internet connection and be able to access GitLab.
- In GitLab 16.1 and later, on self-managed GitLab, you must have an internet connection.

[Self-managed support via a proxy to GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10528) has been proposed.

### Model accuracy and quality

Regardless of whether third-party AI services are enabled, while in Beta, Code Suggestions can generate low-quality, incomplete, and possibly insecure code.
We strongly encourage all beta users to leverage GitLab native
[Code Quality Scanning](../../../ci/testing/code_quality.md) and
[Security Scanning](../../application_security/index.md) capabilities.

GitLab uses a customized open source dataset to fine-tune the model to support multiple languages.
Based on the languages you code in, GitLab routes the request to a targeted inference and prompt engine
to get relevant suggestions.

GitLab is actively refining these models to:

- Improve the quality of recommendations.
- Add support for more languages.
- Add protections to limit personal data, insecure code, and other unwanted behavior
  that the model may have learned from training data.

## Known limitations

While in Beta, we are working on improving the accuracy of overall generated content.
However, Code Suggestions may generate suggestions that are:

- Low-quality
- Incomplete
- Produce failed pipelines
- Insecure code
- Offensive or insensitive

We are also aware of specific situations that can produce unexpected or incoherent results including:

- Suggestions written in the middle of existing functions, or "fill in the middle."
- Suggestions based on natural language code comments.
- Suggestions that mixed programming languages in unexpected ways.

## Feedback

Report issues in the [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/405152).

## Troubleshooting

### Code Suggestions aren't displayed

If Code Suggestions are not displayed, try the following troubleshooting steps.

In GitLab, ensure Code Suggestions is enabled:

- [For your user account](#enable-code-suggestions-for-an-individual-user).
- [For *all* top-level groups your account belongs to](../../group/manage.md#enable-code-suggestions). If you don't have a role that lets you view the top-level group's settings, contact a group owner.

To confirm that your account is enabled, go to [https://gitlab.com/api/v4/ml/ai-assist](https://gitlab.com/api/v4/ml/ai-assist). A response of `user_is_allowed` should return `true`.

If you are a self-managed user, in VS Code, ensure that Code Suggestions for the [GitLab WebIDE](../../project/web_ide/index.md) are enabled:

1. On the left sidebar, select **Extensions > GitLab Workflow**.
1. Select **Settings** (**{settings}**), and then select **Extension Settings**.
1. In **GitLab > AI Assisted Code Suggestions**, select the **Enable code completion (Beta)**
   checkbox.

### Authentication troubleshooting

If the above steps do not solve your issue, the problem may be related to the recent changes in authentication, specifically the token system. To resolve the issue, please follow these troubleshooting steps:

- Remove the existing personal access token from your GitLab account settings.
- Reauthorize your GitLab account in VS Code using OAuth.
- Test the code suggestions feature with different file extensions to verify if the issue is resolved.
