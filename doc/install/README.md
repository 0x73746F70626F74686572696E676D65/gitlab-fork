# Installation **[CORE ONLY]**

GitLab can be installed in most GNU/Linux distributions and in a number
of cloud providers. To get the best experience from GitLab you need to balance:

1. Performance
1. Reliability
1. Ease of administration (backups, upgrades and troubleshooting)
1. Cost of hosting

TIP: **If in doubt, choose Omnibus:**
Our Omnibus GitLab packages are mature, scalable, support
[high availability](../administration/high_availability/README.md) and are used
today on GitLab.com. Our Helm charts are recommended for those who are familiar
with Kubernetes.

## Requirements

Before installing GitLab, make sure to check the [requirements documentation](requirements.md)
which includes useful information on the supported Operating Systems as well as
the hardware requirements.

## Install GitLab using the Omnibus GitLab package (recommended)

This installation method uses the Omnibus GitLab package, using our official
deb/rpm repositories. This is recommended for most users.

If you need additional flexibility and resilience, we recommend deploying
GitLab as described in our [High Availability documentation](../administration/high_availability/README.md).

### Alternative to Omnibus GitLab

If the GitLab Omnibus package is not available in your distribution, you can
choose between:

- [Installing GitLab from source](installation.md): Useful for unsupported
  systems like *BSD. For an overview of the directory structure, read the
  [structure documentation](structure.md). While the recommended database is
  PostgreSQL, we provide information to install GitLab
  [using MySQL](database_mysql.md).
- [Installing Omnibus GitLab using Docker](docker.md).

## Install GitLab on Kubernetes via the GitLab Helm charts

NOTE: **Kubernetes experience required:**
We recommend being familiar with Kubernetes before using it to deploy GitLab in
production. The methods for management, observability, and some concepts are
different than traditional deployments.

When installing GitLab on Kubernetes, there are some trade-offs that you
need to be aware of:

- Administration and troubleshooting requires Kubernetes knowledge.
- It can be more expensive for smaller installations. The default installation
  requires more resources than a single node Omnibus deployment, as most services
  are deployed in a redundant fashion.
- There are some feature [limitations to be aware of](kubernetes/gitlab_chart.md#limitations).
