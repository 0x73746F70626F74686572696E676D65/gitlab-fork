            # line_codes are used for assigning notes to diffs, and these depend on the line on the new version and the
            # line that would have been that one in the previous version. However, since we do a transformation on the
            # file, that mapping gets lost. To overcome this, we look at the original source lines and build two maps:
            # - For additions, we look at the latest line change for that line and pick the old line for that id
            # - For removals, we look at the first line in the old version, and pick the first line on the new version
            #
            # Note: ipynb files never change the first or last line (open and closure of the
            # json object), unless the file is removed or deleted
