services: # Cloud connector features (i.e. code_suggestions, duo_chat...)
  code_suggestions:
    # The name of the backend who is serving this service. The name is used as a token audience claim.
    backend: 'gitlab-ai-gateway'
    # Represents the cut-off date when the service is no longer available for free (beta)
    # If it's not set, the service is available for free (in beta) by default
    # During free access period, all unit primitives will be available for free
    cut_off_date: 2024-02-15 00:00:00 UTC
    # The group of UP that are bundled and sold together.
    # Example: code_suggestions and duo_chat are 2 UP sold together under DUO_PRO add-on.
    # Unit primitives from different services can be bundled and sold together under same add-on.
    # The same UP can be also bundled with different add-ons.
