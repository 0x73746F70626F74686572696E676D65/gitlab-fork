      # NOTE: This constructor intentionally does not follow all of the conventions from
      #       https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/reusing_abstractions.html#service-classes
      #       suggesting that the dependencies be passed via the constructor. This is because
      #       the RemoteDevelopment feature architecture follows a more pure-functional style,
      #       by avoiding instance variables and instance state and preferring to pass data
      #       directly in method calls rather than via constructor. We also don't use any of the
      #       provided superclasses like BaseContainerService or its descendants, because all of the
      #       domain logic is isolated and decoupled to the architectural tier below this,
      #       i.e. in the `*Processor` classes, and therefore these superclasses provide nothing
      #       of use. However, we do still conform to the convention of passing the current_user
      #       in the constructor, since this convention is related to security, and worth following
      #       the existing patterns and principle of least surprise.
