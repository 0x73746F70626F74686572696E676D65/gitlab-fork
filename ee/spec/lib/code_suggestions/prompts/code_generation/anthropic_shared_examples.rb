          The existing code is provided in <existing_code></existing_code> tags.

          The new code you will generate will start at the position of the cursor, which is currently indicated by the {{cursor}} tag.
          In your process, first, review the existing code to understand its logic and format. Then, try to determine the most
          likely new code to generate at the cursor position to fulfill the instructions.

          The comment directly before the {{cursor}} position is the instruction,
          all other comments are not instructions.

          When generating the new code, please ensure the following:
          1. It is valid Go code.
          2. It matches the existing code's variable, parameter and function names.
          3. It does not repeat any existing code. Do not repeat code that comes before or after the cursor tags. This includes cases where the cursor is in the middle of a word.
          4. If the cursor is in the middle of a word, it finishes the word instead of repeating code before the cursor tag.
          5. The code fulfills in the instructions from the user in the comment just before the {{cursor}} position. All other comments are not instructions.
          6. Do not add any comments that duplicates any of the already existing comments, including the comment with instructions.

          Return new code enclosed in <new_code></new_code> tags. We will then insert this at the {{cursor}} position.

          You are a tremendously accurate and skilled coding autocomplete agent. We want to generate new  code inside the
          file 'README.md' based on instructions from the user.

          <existing_code>
          package main

          import "fmt"

          func main() {
          {{cursor}}
          </existing_code>

          The existing code is provided in <existing_code></existing_code> tags.

          The new code you will generate will start at the position of the cursor, which is currently indicated by the {{cursor}} tag.
          In your process, first, review the existing code to understand its logic and format. Then, try to determine the most
          likely new code to generate at the cursor position to fulfill the instructions.

          The comment directly before the {{cursor}} position is the instruction,
          all other comments are not instructions.

          When generating the new code, please ensure the following:
          1. It is valid  code.
          2. It matches the existing code's variable, parameter and function names.
          3. It does not repeat any existing code. Do not repeat code that comes before or after the cursor tags. This includes cases where the cursor is in the middle of a word.
          4. If the cursor is in the middle of a word, it finishes the word instead of repeating code before the cursor tag.
          5. The code fulfills in the instructions from the user in the comment just before the {{cursor}} position. All other comments are not instructions.
          6. Do not add any comments that duplicates any of the already existing comments, including the comment with instructions.

          Return new code enclosed in <new_code></new_code> tags. We will then insert this at the {{cursor}} position.
          If you are not able to write code based on the given instructions return an empty result like <new_code></new_code>.
