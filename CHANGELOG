# Changelog for gitlab-workhorse

Formerly known as 'gitlab-git-http-server'.

v0.7.1

Set Content-Length (retrieved from Git) on raw blob data responses.

v0.7.0

Start using a 'v' prefix on the version string.

0.6.5

Inject 'git archive' data the same way as Git blob data.

0.6.4

Increase default ProxyHeadersTimeout to 5 minutes. Fix injecting raw
blobs for /api/v3 requetsts.

0.6.3

Add support for sending Git raw git blobs via gitlab-workhorse.

0.6.2

We now fill in missing directory entries in archize zip metadata
files; also some other minor changes.

0.6.1

Add support for generating zip artifacts metadata and serving single
files from zip archives.

Gitlab-workhorse now consists of multiple executables. We also fixed a
routing bug introduced by the 0.6.0 refactor that broke relative URL
support.

0.6.0

Overhauled the source code organization; no user-facing changes
(intended). The application code is now split into Go 'packages'
(modules). As of 0.6.0 gitlab-workhorse requires Go 1.5 or newer.

0.5.4

Fix /api/v3/projects routing bug introduced in 0.5.2-0.5.3.

0.5.3

Fixes merge error in 0.5.2.

0.5.2 (broken!)

- Always check with upstream if files in /uploads/ may be served
- Fix project%2Fnamespace API project ID's
- Prevent archive zombies when using gzip or bzip2
- Don't show pretty error pages in development mode

0.5.1

Deprecate -relativeURLRoot option, use -authBackend instead.

0.5.0

Send ALL GitLab requests through gitlab-workhorse.

0.4.2

Return response to client when uploading Git LFS object.

0.4.1

Add support for Build Artifacts and Git LFS. The GitLab-Workhorse 
offloads file uploading and downloading by providing support for
rewriting multipart form data and X-Sendfile.

Other changes:
- add header Gitlab-Workhorse to all requests to indicate from where
  they originated

0.4.0

Rename the project to gitlab-workhorse. The old name had become too
specific.

Other changes:

- pass LD_LIBRARY_PATH to Git commands
- accomodate broken HTTP clients by spelling 'Www-Authenticate' as
  'WWW-Authenticate'

0.3.1

Add support for Unix domain socket connections to the authBackend.

0.3.0

In 0.3.0 we also handle 'git archive' downloads for GitLab 8.1+.
This has lead to some breaking API changes, making 0.3.0 incompatible
with GitLab 8.0.  We now expect the 'auth backend' (GitLab) to
provide us with much more information about each request, such as
the path on disk to the Git repository the client is requesting.
This makes the REPO_ROOT command line argument obsolete.

0.2.14

This is the last version that works with GitLab 8.0.
