# Changelog for gitlab-workhorse

Formerly known as 'gitlab-git-http-server'.

0.5.1

Deprecate -relativeURLRoot option, use -authBackend instead.

0.5.0

Send ALL GitLab requests through gitlab-workhorse.

0.4.2

Return response to client when uploading Git LFS object.

0.4.1

Add support for Build Artifacts and Git LFS. The GitLab-Workhorse 
offloads file uploading and downloading by providing support for
rewriting multipart form data and X-Sendfile.

Other changes:
- add header Gitlab-Workhorse to all requests to indicate from where
  they originated

0.4.0

Rename the project to gitlab-workhorse. The old name had become too
specific.

Other changes:

- pass LD_LIBRARY_PATH to Git commands
- accomodate broken HTTP clients by spelling 'Www-Authenticate' as
  'WWW-Authenticate'

0.3.1

Add support for Unix domain socket connections to the authBackend.

0.3.0

In 0.3.0 we also handle 'git archive' downloads for GitLab 8.1+.
This has lead to some breaking API changes, making 0.3.0 incompatible
with GitLab 8.0.  We now expect the 'auth backend' (GitLab) to
provide us with much more information about each request, such as
the path on disk to the Git repository the client is requesting.
This makes the REPO_ROOT command line argument obsolete.

0.2.14

This is the last version that works with GitLab 8.0.
