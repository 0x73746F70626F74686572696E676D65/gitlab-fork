# GitLab-Specific Markdown

Currently, only some of the GitLab-specific markdown features are
listed in this section. We will eventually add all
GitLab-specific features currently listed as supported in the
[user-facing documentation for GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html).

There is currently only this single top-level heading, but the
examples may be split into multiple top-level headings in the future.

## Footnotes

See
[the footnotes section of the user-facing documentation for GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#footnotes).

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab footnote
footnote reference tag [^fortytwo]

[^fortytwo]: footnote text
.
<p>
footnote reference tag
<sup>
<a href="#fn-fortytwo-42" id="fnref-fortytwo-42" data-footnote-ref>
1
</a>
</sup>
</p>
<section data-footnotes>
<ol>
<li id="fn-fortytwo-42">
<p>
footnote text
<a href="#fnref-fortytwo-42" data-footnote-backref>
</a>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
````````````````````````````````

## Task list items

See
[Task lists](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#task-lists) in the GitLab Flavored Markdown documentation.

Task list items (checkboxes) are defined as a GitHub Flavored Markdown extension in a section above.
GitLab extends the behavior of task list items to support additional features.
Some of these features are in-progress, and should not yet be considered part of the official
GitLab Flavored Markdown specification.

Some of the behavior of task list items is implemented as client-side JavaScript/CSS.

The following are some basic examples; more examples may be added in the future.

Incomplete task:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab tasklist
- [ ] incomplete
.
<ul>
<li>
<task-button/>
<input type="checkbox" disabled/>
incomplete
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

Completed task:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab tasklist
- [x] completed
.
<ul>
<li>
<task-button/>
<input type="checkbox" checked disabled/>
completed
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

Inapplicable task:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab tasklist
- [~] inapplicable
.
<ul>
<li>
<task-button/>
<input type="checkbox" data-inapplicable disabled>
<s>
inapplicable
</s>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

Inapplicable task in a "loose" list. Note that the `<del>` tag is not applied to the
loose text; it has strikethrough applied with CSS.

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab tasklist
- [~] inapplicable

  text in loose list
.
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<task-button/>
<input type="checkbox" data-inapplicable disabled>
<s>
inapplicable
</s>
</p>
<p>
text in loose list
</p>
</li>
</ul>
````````````````````````````````

## Front matter

See
[Front matter](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#front-matter) in the GitLab Flavored Markdown documentation.

Front matter is metadata included at the beginning of a Markdown document, preceding the content.
This data can be used by static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, and many other applications.

YAML front matter:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab frontmatter
---
title: YAML front matter
---
.
<pre>
<code>
title: YAML front matter
</code>
</pre>
````````````````````````````````

TOML front matter:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab frontmatter
+++
title: TOML front matter
+++
.
<pre>
<code>
title: TOML front matter
</code>
</pre>
````````````````````````````````

JSON front matter:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab frontmatter
;;;
{
  "title": "JSON front matter"
}
;;;
.
<pre>
<code>
{
  "title": "JSON front matter"
}
</code>
</pre>
````````````````````````````````

Front matter blocks should be inserted at the top of the document:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab frontmatter
text

---
title: YAML front matter
---
.
<p>text</p>
<hr>
<h2>title: YAML front matter</h2>
````````````````````````````````

Front matter block delimiters shouldnâ€™t be preceded by space characters:

```````````````````````````````` example gitlab frontmatter
 ---
title: YAML front matter
---
.
<hr>
<h2>title: YAML front matter</h2>
````````````````````````````````
