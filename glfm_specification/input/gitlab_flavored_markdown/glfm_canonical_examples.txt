# GitLab-Specific Markdown

Currently, only some of the GitLab-specific markdown features are
listed in this section. We will eventually add all
GitLab-specific features currently listed as supported in the
[user-facing documentation for GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html).

There is currently only this single top-level heading, but the
examples may be split into multiple top-level headings in the future.

## Footnotes

[the footnotes section of the user-facing documentation for GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#footnotes).
